# Machine Learning Projects

## Neural Network SMS Text Classifier
- **Platform**: Google Colaboratory
- **Objective**: Classify SMS messages as "ham" (normal) or "spam."
- **Dataset**: SMS Spam Collection dataset, pre-split into training and test data.
- **Method**: Created a function `predict_message` to classify a message as "ham" or "spam" using a neural network model.

## Book Recommendation Engine using KNN
- **Platform**: Google Colaboratory
- **Objective**: Generate book recommendations based on similarity using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.
- **Dataset**: Book-Crossings dataset, with 1.1 million ratings for 270,000 books by 90,000 users.
- **Method**: Built a function `get_recommends` that takes a book title as input and returns a list of five recommended books based on similarity.
